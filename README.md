#Magento 2 Installer

So this is currently a wrapper around [MageInferno's docker setup](https://mageinferno.com/blog/magento-2-development-docker-os-x) for OS.

This uses `docker`, `docker-compose`, `virtualbox`, `vagrant` and `dinghy`.

To install these requirements:

    brew update
    brew install docker
    brew install docker-compose
    brew cask install virtualbox
    brew cask install vagrant
    brew install https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy/raw/latest/dinghy.rb
